INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 4 threads
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net c/r/clk is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin c/r/r[4][7]_i_3/O, cell c/r/r[4][7]_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT c/r/r[4][7]_i_3 is driving clock pin of 28 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    c/r/r_reg[4][0]_lopt_replica {FDRE}
    c/r/r_reg[4][6] {FDRE}
    c/r/pc_reg[7] {FDRE}
    c/r/r_reg[0][5] {FDRE}
    c/r/r_reg[0][7] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (ZPS7-1) PS7 block required - The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
